# Chip8-emu

Chip8 is an interpreted programming language from the mid-1970s. I'm hoping to write a fully working emulator for it in Python. It's still in its early stages, but it works and is pretty stable at the moment.

I've included the most popular ROMs for Chip 8 as well, as they're in the public domain. Enjoy!
